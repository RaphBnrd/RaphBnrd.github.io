I'm a 2nd year PhD student at University of Montpellier (France), mainly in the Inria team [IROKO](https://team.inria.fr/iroko/) at LIRMM. I'm working under the supervision of [Alexis Joly](https://sites.google.com/view/alexis-joly-inria/home/), [Maximilien Servajean](https://maximiliense.github.io/), and [Christophe Botella](http://christophebotella.fr/). This project is integrated into the [Pl@ntNet](https://www.plantnet.org/en/) project, a citizen science project for plant identification and biodiversity monitoring.

My research is focused on **plant diversity monitoring**. In particular, I am interested in statistics and machine learning techniques for **Species Distribution Models** (SDM) using **Citizen Science** data. These methods aim to keep track of plant species distributions and their changes over time, in order to better understand the impact of global changes on biodiversity (more details [here](/projects/mapping_plant_species/)).

Previously, I worked on the impact of forest roads on bird communities (more details [here](/projects/birds_and_roads/)) and on the sensitivity of fish stocks to climate change (more details [here](/projects/drivers_of_fish_stocks/)).

I'm also involoved in teaching activities at [Polytech Montpellier](https://www.polytech.umontpellier.fr/) in maths, statistics and computer science.

I have a background in applied mathematics and computer science and also a background in ecology. More broadly, I have interests in global changes such as biodiversity loss, pollutions and climate change (scientific background, international negotiations, policies for mitigation and adaptation, etc.).
