This project was initiated based on my Master's thesis work within the Research Training Group [ConFoBi](https://confobi.uni-freiburg.de/en) ([projet B6](https://confobi.uni-freiburg.de/en/projects/bird-forest-relationships-b6) on relationships between forest and birds), as part of my Master's degree in Biodiversity, Ecology, and Evolution at the [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en). It contributed to [Mariela Yapu Alcazar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mariela-Yapu-Alcazar)'s PhD research and also under the supervision of [Michael Wohlwend](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Wohlwend). The findings have been accepted in *Ecology and Evolution* {% cite yapu2025effects %}, waiting for publication. The preprint version is still available on [Authorea](https://doi.org/10.22541/au.174617643.38377034/v1).

### Summary

This project explored how **unpaved forest roads and paths** influence **bird communities** in the **southern Black Forest (Germany)**, a landscape managed under *close-to-nature forestry* combining wood production, conservation, and recreation (Bauhus et al., 2013; Storch et al., 2020). These management activities create a dense network of small roads and trails that slightly open the forest canopy. While the ecological impacts of large paved roads are well known (Benítez-López, Alkemade & Verweij, 2010), the subtler effects of these **narrow, low-traffic structures** remain less understood (Šálek et al., 2010; Mammides et al., 2016).

**Bird surveys** were conducted along a gradient of **canopy openness**—from forest interiors to paths, unpaved roads, and forest edges—following standardized **point count methods** (Bibby, 2000; Balestrieri et al., 2017). The results showed that **species richness** remained relatively constant across all habitat types. However, **community composition** and **functional traits** (body mass and wing shape) (Tobias et al., 2022) only shifted at forest edges, suggesting that small canopy openings along roads and paths do not replicate true edge effects. Birds appeared to treat these linear features as part of the forest rather than as distinct habitats.

Overall, the study indicates that **narrow forest roads** have a **limited ecological footprint** on bird assemblages in structurally diverse, managed forests. This work contributes to understanding **small-scale fragmentation** and complements broader research on **road ecology** (Coffin et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2023).
