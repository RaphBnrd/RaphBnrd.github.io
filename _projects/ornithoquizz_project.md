</span>

During my Master's Thesis internship at the University of Freiburg (more details on this project [here](/projects/birds_and_roads/)), I had to learn bird identification starting from zero. To do so, I created a quiz game... Since it may be useful for others, I made it available online. 

It is based on the [Xeno-Canto](https://www.xeno-canto.org/) database of bird sounds and [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/) for the images. 
The game is still in a prototype version, and I plan to improve it in the future. Do not hesitate if you have any suggestions or if you want to contribute.
