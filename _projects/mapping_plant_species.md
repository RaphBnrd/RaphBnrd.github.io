This project is my PhD thesis work at Universit√© de Montpellier (France), in [Inria](https://inria.fr/en)/[LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/lirmm-en/) team. It started in October 2024 under the supervision of [Alexis Joly](https://sites.google.com/view/alexis-joly-inria/home/), [Maximilien Servajean](https://maximiliense.github.io/), and [Christophe Botella](http://christophebotella.fr/).

The current directions are described below. \\

## Summary

Monitoring **species distributions** is critical for understanding ecological dynamics and informing conservation efforts, especially in the context of current **global changes**. Although **opportunistic data** from **citizen science** programs offer extensive spatial and temporal coverage, they are affected by substantial sampling and detection biases. This PhD thesis proposes a method for estimating species distributions and their temporal trends from presence-only data using **hierarchical site-occupancy models** that account for both types of bias. We explore the use of deep learning to fit these models efficiently and flexibly. We plan to apply this framework to **real-world datasets, such as Pl@ntNet**, and further investigate model extensions that incorporate more complex observer behaviors and detection processes using various neural network architectures. We will use these models to assess **trends** in plant species in terms of coverage, population changes and range shifts. Furthermore, one of the objectives of this PhD is to study the **factors that influence these trends** such as land use changes, climate change, and pollution.
