This project was based on my Master's thesis work within [ISEM](https://isem-evolution.fr/en/equipe/biodiversity-dynamics-interactions-and-conservation-team/). It was under the supervision of [Vasilis Dakos](https://www.vasilisdakos.info/) and [Alejandro Viloria Cano](https://isem-evolution.fr/en/membre/viloria-cano/). The findings are still being prepared for publication.

### Summary

**Global fisheries** are under pressure from **overfishing** and **climate change**. While **attribution methodologies** provide outstanding information on the drivers of biodiversity change, they mostly rely on mechanistic models, species distribution models, controlled environment experiments, and expert knowledge. Here, a **data-driven, equation-free method** (Empirical Dynamic Modeling / Convergent Cross-Mapping) was applied to **150+ global fish stocks** to directly test whether **harvest rate** and **sea surface temperature (SST)** cause changes in stock productivity.

**Fishing pressure** was the most common causal driver, confirming that exploitation strongly shapes stock dynamics. Its effect was **stock-specific**, but mostly **positive**, and also often becoming **more negative over time**, indicating that fishing impacts are worsening.

**SST** was also identified as a significant causal driver, showing that climate change impacts productivity. Unlike fishing, the effect of warming was mostly **negative** and often became even **more negative over time**, suggesting that **climate impacts are intensifying**.

Overall, this work shows that:
- **Data-driven causality approaches** can complement traditional models to identify drivers of fish stock dynamics.
- **Fishing remains the dominant driver**, but its effect depends on the stock, even if often getting more negative over time.
- **Climate warming is a driver**, mainly negative and intensifying over time.
